You'll always have a choice between life and death.

Yet another mod with a respawn system, with the difference being that you get to choose whether to respawn or not upon each death. You can also reset your respawn point by holding the 'Set Respawn Point' key for a second, which is 'T' by default and can be configured in the mod settings. Additionally, there are options to respawn with lower health and to drop some fraction of gold on death, all of which can be configured.

### Meta Leveling Integration
The Meta Leveling respawn system requires its corresponding mod. You won't be able to use it unless it is enabled. However, this isn't a strict requirement; the rest of the mod's features will work fine without it.

Get it here, [Meta Leveling](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3338209310).

## New Respawn Systems
This mod now includes multiple respawn systems.

The Unlimited and Limited systems are straightforward; they affect the number of revives you'll have in a game. The Meta Leveling option uses the Meta Leveling mod's XP system to allow you to earn revives as you progress.

The mod also displays stats for death count and the number of revives you have left. Only the death count will be shown for the Unlimited respawn system.

A reward has also been added to ML that grants you a revive, and it's probability of appearing can be adjusted in the settings.

This update introduced a lot of changes. I've tested it sufficiently, but if you experience any bugs, do report them.
